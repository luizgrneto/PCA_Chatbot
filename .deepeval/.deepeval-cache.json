It advocates formalizing and (when beneficial) automating critical steps of ML system \\nconstruction. MLOps provides a set of standardized processes and technology capabilities for building, deploying, \\nand operationalizing ML systems rapidly and reliably.\\nMLOps supports ML development and deployment in the way that DevOps and DataOps support application engi -\\nneering and data engineering (analytics). The difference is that when you deploy a web service, you care about resil -\\nience, queries per second, load balancing, and so on. When you deploy an ML model, you also need to worry about \\nchanges in the data, changes in the model, users trying to game the system, and so on. This is what MLOps is about.\", \"accommodate the ML lifecycle.

Without proper centralized monitoring, individual models might experience performance issues that go unnoticed, impacting overall accuracy.\\n\\nWhat's the relationship to DevOps?\\n\\nMLOps and DevOps focus on different aspects of the development process. DevOps focuses on streamlining the development, testing and deployment of traditional software applications. It emphasizes collaboration between development and operations teams to automate processes and improve software delivery speed and quality.\\n\\nMLOps builds upon DevOps principles and applies them to the machine learning lifecycle. It goes beyond deploying code, encompassing data management, model training, monitoring and continuous improvement.\", \"What are the key elements of an effective MLOps strategy?\\n\\nMLOps requires skills, tools and practices to effectively manage the machine learning lifecycle. MLOps teams need a diverse skillset encompassing both technical and soft skills. They must understand the entire data science pipeline, from data preparation and model training to evaluation. Familiarity with software engineering practices like version control, CI/CD pipelines and containerization are also crucial. In addition, knowledge of DevOps principles, infrastructure management and automation tools is essential for the efficient deployment and operation of ML models.\", \"What is MLOps?\\n\\nMLOps, short for machine learning operations, is a set of practices designed to create an assembly line for building and running machine learning models. It helps companies automate tasks and deploy models quickly, ensuring everyone involved (data scientists, engineers, IT) can cooperate smoothly and monitor and improve models for better accuracy and performance.\\n\\nThe term MLops is a combination of machine learning (ML) and DevOps. The term was coined in 2015 in a paper called \\\"Hidden technical debt in machine learning systems,\\\" which outlined the challenges inherent in dealing with large volumes of data and how to use DevOps processes to instill better ML practices. Creating an MLOps process incorporates continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) methodology from DevOps to create an assembly line for each step in creating a machine learning product.\", \"strategic in their decision-making.\\nSimilarities between MLOPs and DevOps\\nBoth MLOps and DevOps share a need for process automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery .\\nIt also helps to have proper testing of the code base for both MLOps and DevOps.\\nIn addition, there should be adequate collaboration between software developers and those who manage the infrastructure, as well as other stakeholders.\\nDissimilarities between MLOps and DevOps\\nAlthough MLOps is derived from DevOps, there are subtle dif ferences between the two.\\nIn MLOps, data is a necessary input for developing the machine learning model.

They also cannot be built without adopting and applying sound software \\nengineering practices, while taking into account the factors that make operationalizing ML different from operational -\\nizing other types of software.\\nOrganizations need an automated and streamlined ML process.

This approach is what the diagram \\ndepicts. The diagram shows a standard CI/CD workflow, which consists of \\nthese stages:\\n1. In the CI stage, the source code is unit-tested, and the training pipe -\\nline is built and integration-tested. Any artifacts that are \\ncreated by the build are stored in an artifact repository.\\nFigure 6. The training operationalization process\\nTraining \\nOperationalization\", \"tion 4.4, we discuss organizational efforts to effectively evaluate\\nmodels. Finally, in Section 4.5, we investigate the hacks ML engi-\\nneers use to sustain high performance in productions ML pipelines.\\n4.1 Tasks in the Production ML Lifecycle\\nWe characterized ML engineers\\u2019 workflows into four high-level\\ntasks, each of which employ a wide variety of tools. We briefly\\ndescribe each task in turn, and elaborate on them as they arise in\\nour findings below.\\nData Collection and Labeling. Data collection spans sourcing\\nnew data, wrangling data from sources into a centralized reposi-\\ntory, and cleaning data. Data labeling can be outsourced (e.g., Me-\\nchanical Turk) or performed in-house with teams of annotators.\\nSince descriptions and interview studies of data collection, anal-\\nysis, wrangling and labeling activities can be found in related pa-\\npers , we focus our summary of findings on the other\\nthree tasks.\\nFeature Engineering and Model Experimentation.

But you know, even\\nwhen it does get written down, maybe you will read\\nthem, but then, they kind of disappear to the ether.\\nFinally, P17 realized that poorly documented pipelines forced\\nthem to treat pipelines as black boxes: \\u201cSome of our models are\\npretty old and not well documented, so I don\\u2019t have great expec-\\ntations for what they should be doing.\\u201d Without intuition for how\\npipelines should perform, practitioner productivity can be stunted.\\nTakeaway.

DevOps focuses on streamlining the development, testing and deployment of traditional software applications. It emphasizes collaboration between development and operations teams to automate processes and improve software delivery speed and quality.\\n\\nMLOps builds upon DevOps principles and applies them to the machine learning lifecycle.

MLOps teams need a diverse skillset encompassing both technical and soft skills. They must understand the entire data science pipeline, from data preparation and model training to evaluation. Familiarity with software engineering practices like version control, CI/CD pipelines and containerization are also crucial. In addition, knowledge of DevOps principles, infrastructure management and automation tools is essential for the efficient deployment and operation of ML models.\", \"What is MLOps?\\n\\nMLOps, short for machine learning operations, is a set of practices designed to create an assembly line for building and running machine learning models. It helps companies automate tasks and deploy models quickly, ensuring everyone involved (data scientists, engineers, IT) can cooperate smoothly and monitor and improve models for better accuracy and performance.\\n\\nThe term MLops is a combination of machine learning (ML) and DevOps. The term was coined in 2015 in a paper called \\\"Hidden technical debt in machine learning systems,\\\" which outlined the challenges inherent in dealing with large volumes of data and how to use DevOps processes to instill better ML practices. Creating an MLOps process incorporates continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) methodology from DevOps to create an assembly line for each step in creating a machine learning product.\", \"strategic in their decision-making.\\nSimilarities between MLOPs and DevOps\\nBoth MLOps and DevOps share a need for process automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery .\\nIt also helps to have proper testing of the code base for both MLOps and DevOps.\\nIn addition, there should be adequate collaboration between software developers and those who manage the infrastructure, as well as other stakeholders.\\nDissimilarities between MLOps and DevOps\\nAlthough MLOps is derived from DevOps, there are subtle dif ferences between the two.\\nIn MLOps, data is a necessary input for developing the machine learning model.

Since\", \"different failure modes in the offline validation phase\\u2014e.g., perfor-\\nmance drops in subpopulations users might care deeply about\\u2014likeP11 did, P8 offered a reactive strategy of spawning a new dataset\\nfor each observed live failure: \\u201cEvery gets into\\nthe same queue, and 3 of us sit down once a week and go through\\nthe queue...then our collect more data.\\u201d This\\nnew dataset was then used in the offline validation phase in future\\niterations of the production ML lifecycle.\\nWhile processes to dynamically update the validation datasets\\nranged from human-in-the-loop to frequent synthetic data con-\\nstruction (P6), we found that higher-stakes applications of ML (e.g.,\\nautonomous vehicles), created separate teams to manage the dy-\\nnamic evaluation process. P1 said:\\nWe had to move away from only aggregate metrics like\\nMAP towards the ability to curate scenarios of interest,\\nand then validate model performance on them specifi-\\ncally.

They also cannot be built without adopting and applying sound software \\nengineering practices, while taking into account the factors that make operationalizing ML different from operational -\\nizing other types of software.\\nOrganizations need an automated and streamlined ML process.

In the CI stage, the source code is unit-tested, and the training pipe -\\nline is built and integration-tested. Any artifacts that are \\ncreated by the build are stored in an artifact repository.\\nFigure 6.

Finally, in Section 4.5, we investigate the hacks ML engi-\\nneers use to sustain high performance in productions ML pipelines.\\n4.1 Tasks in the Production ML Lifecycle\\nWe characterized ML engineers\\u2019 workflows into four high-level\\ntasks, each of which employ a wide variety of tools. We briefly\\ndescribe each task in turn, and elaborate on them as they arise in\\nour findings below.\\nData Collection and Labeling. Data collection spans sourcing\\nnew data, wrangling data from sources into a centralized reposi-\\ntory, and cleaning data. Data labeling can be outsourced (e.g., Me-\\nchanical Turk) or performed in-house with teams of annotators.\\nSince descriptions and interview studies of data collection, anal-\\nysis, wrangling and labeling activities can be found in related pa-\\npers , we focus our summary of findings on the other\\nthree tasks.\\nFeature Engineering and Model Experimentation.

Evaluation is critical to ensure that the models perform well in real-world scenarios. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and fairness measures gauge how well the model meets the project objectives. These metrics provide a quantitative basis for comparing different models and selecting the best one for deployment. Through careful evaluation, data scientists can identify and address potential issues, such as bias or overfitting, ensuring that the final model is effective and fair.\\n\\nModel deployment\", \"cloud platforms or on-premises infrastructure.\\nIt is crucial to consider aspects such as scalability, security, and\\nperformance during the deployment phase.

It advocates formalizing and (when beneficial) automating critical steps of ML system \\nconstruction. MLOps provides a set of standardized processes and technology capabilities for building, deploying, \\nand operationalizing ML systems rapidly and reliably.\\nMLOps supports ML development and deployment in the way that DevOps and DataOps support application engi -\\nneering and data engineering (analytics). The difference is that when you deploy a web service, you care about resil -\\nience, queries per second, load balancing, and so on. When you deploy an ML model, you also need to worry about \\nchanges in the data, changes in the model, users trying to game the system, and so on. This is what MLOps is about.\", \"accommodate the ML lifecycle. This integration ensures a streamlined and\\nefficient development process, ultimately leading to more reliable AI\\napplications and lower maintenance costs.\\nTo summarise, ML Ops builds upon DevOps principles and customises them\\nto suit the unique challenges of machine learning projects, thus enabling a\\nmore seamless and efficient management of these projects throughout\\ntheir lifecycle.11/11/25, 10:05 PM MLOps Now - What is MLOps?

In\\nthis phase, data engineers work together with data scientists to prepare\\nand preprocess the data, performing featur e engineering to ensure the\", \"seamless and efficient integration of ML into existing processes.\\nMLOps is more than just the technical side of ML lifecycle management; it\\nalso incorporates best practices and methods used in software\\ndevelopment and DevOps. Bridging the gap between data scientists, ML\\nengineers, and DevOps, ML Ops enables a more coordinated approach to\\nML projects. T eams can more easily track, reproduce, and iterate on\\nmodels, ensuring stability and performance in production environments.\\nBy adopting an ML Ops approach, organisations not only position\\nthemselves for better scalability and faster deployment of ML models, but\\nalso optimise resources and reduce risk.
